# SudokuSolver
Sudoku solver in C++. 

## Language Standard
By default the code uses C++20 language standard features to calculate the timestamp of the solution. 
By defining the preprocessor definition SUDOKU_DISABLE_TIMESTAMP, you can remove this feature. And compile on earlier C++ standards.

## Usage
See example.cpp
